## OAuth2 Authorization Server

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's resources on a server. It is widely used for secure and delegated access in various web and mobile applications. In an OAuth 2.0 flow, there are typically two main components: the Authorization Server and the Resource Server.

Here's a high-level overview of how OAuth 2.0 works:

#### Authorization Server:

* The Authorization Server is responsible for authenticating the user and obtaining their consent to grant access to the client application.
* It issues access tokens after successful authentication and authorization.

* Examples of Authorization Servers include services like Google, Facebook, or an organization's own OAuth 2.0 server.

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grant Types:
OAuth 2.0 defines several grant types for different use cases. The common grant types include:

##### Authorization Code Grant:

* Used by web applications.
* Involves a redirect to the Authorization Server, where the user logs in and grants access. An authorization code is then exchanged for an access token.
##### Implicit Grant:

* Used by JavaScript or mobile applications.
* Access token is returned immediately after the user grants access, without an additional authorization code exchange.
##### Client Credentials Grant:

* Used by confidential clients (e.g., server-to-server communication).
* The client authenticates directly with the Authorization Server using its client credentials to obtain an access token.
##### Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant:

* Used when the user trusts the client application with their credentials.
* The client directly obtains the user's username and password to request an access token
